# Hybrid-Classifiers-Based-on-Artificial-Neural-Networks-for-Customer-Attrition-Prediction
This repository comprises of all the Python codes and output that were used to construct Hybrid classifiers utilizing Artificial Neural Networks to predict Customer Attrition. The same data repository (Dunhumby: The Complete Journey) that was used in my Master's thesis was used in this project too.
